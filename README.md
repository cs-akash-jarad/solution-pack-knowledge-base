# solution-pack-knowledge-base

FortiSOAR™ is built using modular architecture and the FortiSOAR™ Knowledge Base Solution Pack is the implementation of the best practices to configure and use FortiSOAR™ in an optimal manner. The FortiSOAR™ Knowledge Base Solution Pack provides the user with information about different things like (triage process, tools etc) used in a SOAR.

## Deploying Knowledge Base Solution Pack

**Important**: Before you deploy the solution pack, ensure that you have deployed the FortiSOAR™ Incident Response Solution Pack ([solution-pack-incident-response](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-incident-response).

The steps for deploying a solution pack are mentioned in the [Deploying a Solution Pack](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/how-tos/blob/main/DeployingASolutionPack.md) article.

More information about the Knowledge Base Solution Pack can be found [here](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-knowledge-base/blob/develop/docs/KBContentPackDoc.md).
